# Portfolio

This is my humble portfolio, built using Alpine.js and TailwindCSS. It's a simple, single-page application that showcases some of my projects.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NAS2pwn/portfolio.git
cd portfolio
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Build output.css

The CSS is built using TailwindCSS, so you need to build the output.css file.

```bash
npm run build
```

If you want to watch for changes in order to modify it, you can run:

```bash
npm run watch
```
